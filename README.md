# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
## Capstone Project 1
This repository is a culmination of spreadsheet, SQL and Tableau data analysis skills I have learned while completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

The Casestudy1.md file contains a complete explanation and report of the work I did, including code examples, thought processes, visualizations and my conclusions. 

I began this project in Google Sheets before switching over to SQL in PostgreSQL and PGAdmin4 to complete the bulk of data cleaning, processing and analysis. Finally, I imported the data into Tableau Public to create visualizations that showcase the trends I make my conclusions on.
